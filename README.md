## **Implementation**

My planning and documentation was hindered. I was forced to jump in, out back in and rush. I'm a fan of trello and would have likely utilised as such.





<br>

### **Testing**

Code was tested manually as I had some issues using pytest. 

Test case 1

Test 1 was to determine if the 4 options given to the user to determine the age of child works as intended.

Expected result: Terminal application accepts user input and continues.

Actual result: User input accepted on all four options. Terminal application accepts user input and continues.



Test 2
The purpose of the second test was do determine if the recipe choice printed as intended.

Expected result: Choice of recipes matching criteria to print, giving user option to select desired recipe.

Actual result: Only one recipe printed. Multiple recipe option failed.

Test 3

Test 3 was to determine if user could add their own recipe and save to csv file.

Expected result: User recipe title and data saved.

Actual result: User recipe title and data saved.
